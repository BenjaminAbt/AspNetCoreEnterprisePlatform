## Goal

This solution represents a sample platform based on ASP.NET Core and Domain Driven Design.

Features is implemented exclusively through a modular, interchangeable feature architecture based on Domain Driven Architecture principles.

## Best Practices

Furthermore, many recommendations of community best practices are included, including an event architecture based on Mediator, generating OpenAPI documents at compile time based on Swashbuckle, Operation-based Logging with Serilog, and much more.

This project is the basis for many of my productive customer projects, my own software, the forum mycsharp.de as well as it serves as the basis for my training series "Flexible and modern Enterprise Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure".

## Remarks

> The structure of this solution is designed to emphasize the separation of the individual components.
