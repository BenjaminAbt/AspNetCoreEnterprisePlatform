# BenjaminAbt.MyDemoPlatform.HttpApi.Sdk

This project contains the API SDK for .NET.

It is used by both the API itself and potential clients, so the models can be used identically.

In addition to the models, this project also provides an API client based on a refit interface, so there is no need for manual implementation in the clients themselves.
